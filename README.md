# Tether

Tether links the physical world to digital memory — one scan at a time.

This project is a prototype for a QR-powered system that creates unique web pages attached to physical objects. These pages let users log events, track maintenance, write notes, and upload content tied to a specific item.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Car maintenance log
- Furnace filter replacement tracker
- Object history or diaries
- Houseplant watering logs
- Custom templates for any physical object

## 🚀 How It Works

Each QR code points to a unique web page. When scanned, it pulls up a log template chosen by the original user — for example, a car maintenance history or a task list.

## 🧪 Current Templates

- Car Maintenance Log (`/logs/car-maintenance.html`)
- Furnace Filter Log (`/logs/furnace-log.html`)
